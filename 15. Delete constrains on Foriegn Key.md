### **Foreign Key Constraints on DELETE**

When defining a foreign key, you can specify different behaviors using `ON DELETE`:

| Constraint              | Description                                                                      |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ON DELETE CASCADE`     | Automatically deletes child rows when the parent row is deleted.                 |
| `ON DELETE SET NULL`    | Sets the foreign key column to `NULL` when the parent row is deleted.            |
| `ON DELETE SET DEFAULT` | Sets the foreign key column to its default value when the parent row is deleted. |
| `ON DELETE RESTRICT`    | Prevents deletion of the parent row if child rows exist.                         |
| `ON DELETE NO ACTION`   | Similar to `RESTRICT`, but allows deferred constraint checking.                  |

### **Syntax**

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

- This ensures that when a customer is deleted, all related orders are also deleted.

### **Example 1: Using `ON DELETE CASCADE`**

```sql
DELETE FROM customers WHERE customer_id = 5;
```

- If `customer_id = 5` exists in the `orders` table, all related orders will be deleted automatically.

### **Example 2: Using `ON DELETE SET NULL`**

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);
```

```sql
DELETE FROM customers WHERE customer_id = 5;
```

- The `customer_id` in `orders` will be set to `NULL` instead of deleting the row.



### **### Example 3: Using  `ON DELETE SET DEFAULT`**

This sets the foreign key column to its **default value** when the referenced row is deleted.


```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT DEFAULT 1,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id) ON DELETE SET DEFAULT
);
```

```sql
DELETE FROM customers WHERE customer_id = 5;
```

- If `customer_id = 5` is deleted, all related rows in `orders` will have `customer_id` set to `1` (the default value).

---

### **Example 4: Using  `ON DELETE RESTRICT`**

Prevents deletion of the parent row if child rows exist.

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id) ON DELETE RESTRICT
);
```

```sql
DELETE FROM customers WHERE customer_id = 5;
```

- If `customer_id = 5` exists in `orders`, PostgreSQL **will not allow** deletion.
