There are several ways to create a table in SQL, depending on your needs and the database system you're using. Here are some common methods:

### 1. **Basic `CREATE TABLE` Statement**

This is the standard way to create a table by defining columns and their data types.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Age INT,
    Department VARCHAR(50)
);
```

### 2. **`CREATE TABLE AS SELECT`**

This method creates a new table based on the structure and data of an existing table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE NewEmployees AS
SELECT EmployeeID, Name, Age FROM Employees;
```

- This copies both structure and data but **does not** copy constraints like primary keys.

### 3. **`SELECT INTO` Statement**

This creates a new table and inserts data from another table.

```sql
SELECT * INTO BackupEmployees FROM Employees;
```

### 4. **`CREATE TABLE LIKE

This creates a new table with the same structure as an existing table but without copying data.

```sql
CREATE TABLE EmployeesCopy LIKE Employees;
```
