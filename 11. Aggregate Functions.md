PostgreSQL offers several aggregate functions that allow you to perform calculations on groups of rows. Hereâ€™s a list of commonly used aggregate functions along with their syntax and descriptions:

### **Basic Aggregate Functions**

|Function Name|Syntax|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`COUNT()`|`SELECT COUNT(column_name) FROM table_name;`|Returns the number of rows in a result set.|
|`SUM()`|`SELECT SUM(column_name) FROM table_name;`|Calculates the sum of values in a numeric column.|
|`AVG()`|`SELECT AVG(column_name) FROM table_name;`|Computes the average value of a numeric column.|
|`MIN()`|`SELECT MIN(column_name) FROM table_name;`|Returns the smallest value in a column.|
|`MAX()`|`SELECT MAX(column_name) FROM table_name;`|Returns the largest value in a column.|

### **Using Aggregate Functions with GROUP BY**

To apply aggregate functions per category:

```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```
