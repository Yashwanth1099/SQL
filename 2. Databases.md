# Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)

A **database** is a collection of organized data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. It stores information in a structured way, often in tables, so that users can quickly find and manipulate the data.

**Table 1: Customers**

| **Customer ID** | **Name**   | **Address** | **Phone Number** |
| --------------- | ---------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| 1001            | John Doe   | 123 Main St | 555-1234         |
| 1002            | Jane Smith | 456 Elm St  | 555-5678         |

Table 2: Accounts

| **Account ID** | **Customer ID** | **Account Type** | **Balance ($)** |
| -------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| 2001           | 1001            | Checking         | 5,000           |
| 2002           | 1001            | Savings          | 10,000          |
| 2003           | 1002            | Checking         | 3,000           |

Table 3: Transactions

| **Transaction ID** | **Account ID** | **Date**   | **Amount ($)** | **Type**   |
| ------------------ | -------------- | ---------- | -------------- | ---------- |
| 3001               | 2001           | 2025-03-01 | 500            | Deposit    |
| 3002               | 2002           | 2025-03-02 | 1,000          | Withdrawal |

In this example:
- The **Customers** table stores customer information.
- The **Accounts** table links customers to their bank accounts.
- The **Transactions** table records each transaction made on an account.

With this database, you could use SQL to:
- Find the balance of a specific account.
- Retrieve all transactions for a particular customer.
- Check the total amount of deposits made in a given month.

This helps financial institutions keep track of accounts, transactions, and customer data efficiently.
