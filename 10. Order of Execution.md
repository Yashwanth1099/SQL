## **SQL queries**

In SQL, the order of execution refers to the sequence in which different clauses of a query are processed. Understanding this sequence is crucial for optimizing queries and ensuring accurate results.

The general order in which SQL processes a query is as follows:

1. **FROM** – Determines the source tables.
2. **WHERE** – Filters records based on conditions.
3. **GROUP BY** – Groups records based on a column.
4. **HAVING** – Filters groups based on conditions.
5. **SELECT** – Retrieves the requested columns.
6. **ORDER BY** – Sorts the result set.
7. **LIMIT** – Restricts the number of rows returned.

### **Flowchart**

Below is a flowchart representation of the SQL order of execution:

```
         +-------------------+
         | FROM              |
         +-------------------+
                |
                v
         +-------------------+
         | WHERE             |
         +-------------------+
                |
                v
         +-------------------+
         | GROUP BY          |
         +-------------------+
                |
                v
         +-------------------+
         | HAVING            |
         +-------------------+
                |
                v
         +-------------------+
         | SELECT            |
         +-------------------+
                |
                v
         +-------------------+
         | ORDER BY          |
         +-------------------+
                |
                v
         +-------------------+
         | LIMIT             |
         +-------------------+
```

### **Example SQL Query**

Consider a scenario where you want to retrieve employees who earn more than $50,000, group them by department, filter groups where the average salary exceeds $60,000, and sort the results.

```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 50000
GROUP BY department
HAVING AVG(salary) > 60000
ORDER BY avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### **Explanation of Execution**

1. **FROM**: The `employees` table is identified as the source.
2. **WHERE**: Only employees earning more than $50,000 are considered.
3. **GROUP BY**: The filtered employees are grouped by `department`.
4. **HAVING**: Groups where the average salary is greater than $60,000 are retained.
5. **SELECT**: The `department` and its `avg_salary` are retrieved.
6. **ORDER BY**: The results are sorted in descending order of average salary.
7. **LIMIT**: The first 5 rows are returned.

This step-by-step approach helps ensure the query runs efficiently and returns the expected results. Let me know if you'd like more examples!



## **Where Conditions** 

In SQL, the `WHERE` clause is used to filter records before grouping and aggregation occurs. When multiple conditions are specified within the `WHERE` clause, they follow a specific logical order of execution based on operator precedence.

### **Order of Execution for `WHERE` Conditions**

The conditions inside the `WHERE` clause are evaluated according to logical precedence rules:

1. **Parentheses `()`** – Expressions inside parentheses are evaluated first.
2. **Comparison Operators (`=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`)** – Basic comparisons between values.
3. **BETWEEN, LIKE, IN** – Range-based filters and pattern matching.
4. **NOT** – Negation of conditions.
5. **AND** – Ensures all conditions must be true.
6. **OR** – Ensures at least one condition must be true.

### **Flowchart Representation**

```
        +-------------------+
        | Parentheses ()    |
        +-------------------+
                |
                v
        +-------------------+
        | Comparisons       |
        +-------------------+
                |
                v
        +-------------------+
        | BETWEEN, LIKE, IN |
        +-------------------+
                |
                v
        +-------------------+
        | NOT               |
        +-------------------+
                |
                v
        +-------------------+
        | AND               |
        +-------------------+
                |
                v
        +-------------------+
        | OR                |
        +-------------------+
```

### **Example Query**

Consider the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE (salary > 50000 OR department = 'IT') AND experience >= 5;
```

### **Execution Steps**

1. **Parentheses `(salary > 50000 OR department = 'IT')`** are evaluated first.
2. **Comparison Operators (`salary > 50000`, `department = 'IT'`, `experience >= 5`)** execute individually.
3. **OR** inside the parentheses ensures at least one of `salary > 50000` or `department = 'IT'` is true.
4. **AND** ensures that only results matching `experience >= 5` along with the OR condition are retained.

By understanding this execution order, you can optimize complex `WHERE` clauses for accurate results. Let me know if you need more examples!
